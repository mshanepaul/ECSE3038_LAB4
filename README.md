## Learning Postgres

### This assignment is to modify the previous simple API by adding Postgres

### Two routes were edited to use the new database:
#### NOTE: default GET is added to display the data  


## Aim

This lap is meant to get students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing a RESTful API server.

## Requirements

*[ You wake up and realise that everything in your room is on the opposite side. Not just the items in the room but the room itself! Everything is flipped, swapped and reversed. You conclude that this must be an parallel universe where No-SQL databases doesn't exist ]*

The specifications have shifted slightly since the last developer meeting. Your client's budget recently increased and now they're able to pay for a database service. You've done your research and found that PostgreSQL is the most suitable database platform for the project. With this new information, the client has asked that you modify the API server to store all `Tank` related data to be stored in the database. The `Profile` data can be handled the same way as it was originally implemented, where the profile data is saved in a variable on the server. If you want to modify the `Profile` routes to save the data in the database as well, you may, but you don't have to (you won't get extra marks if you do and you won't lose marks if you don't).
